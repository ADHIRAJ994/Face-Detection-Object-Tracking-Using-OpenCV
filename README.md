# Face-Detection-Object-Tracking-Using-OpenCV
This project uses OpenCV’s **Haar Cascade Classifiers**, pre-trained models that identify patterns of human faces and eyes.   Each video frame is converted to grayscale, processed for pattern recognition, and outlined with rectangles when a match is found. It’s a simple yet powerful example of real-time **computer vision** and **image processing**.
## Features

-  Real-time **face detection** from webcam or image file  
-  Accurate **eye detection**, even with eyeglasses  
-  Fast and lightweight — works efficiently on most systems  
-  Fully based on OpenCV’s **Haar Cascade Classifiers**  
-  Displays live video feed with rectangles around detected faces and eyes

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.7+**  
- **OpenCV (cv2)**  
- Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**
