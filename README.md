# Face-Detection-Object-Tracking-Using-OpenCV
This project uses OpenCV’s **Haar Cascade Classifiers**, pre-trained models that identify patterns of human faces and eyes.   Each video frame is converted to grayscale, processed for pattern recognition, and outlined with rectangles when a match is found. It’s a simple yet powerful example of real-time **computer vision** and **image processing**.
